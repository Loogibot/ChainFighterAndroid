# ChainFighterAndroid
Android and Kotlin version of ChainFighter game created by me, Loogibot.
It is based on a Tkinter and Python version of the same game, shown below, with many changes to base functionalities.

The Android variant of the game is still under development to implement the titular chain mechanice, but a (somewhat) 
playable prototype is available in the SoC2 branch -> https://github.com/Loogibot/ChainFighterAndroid/tree/SoC2

Here is the latest update to ChainFighter, with major changes to the ui inspired by the Tkinter version of the
game. There is now Dark/Night mode support across the application. A soundtrack for the title, gameplay and 
final results screen has been added. Sound effects have also been added to the player's moves on button click.
All of the music was written, recorded and mixed by me on Garageband for iPad, and the foleys were mixed and
edited by me with sounds downloaded from https://freesound.org/.
